# Setup

Welcome to your Redux Tutorial project on Nitrous.

## Running the development server:

In the [Nitrous IDE](https://community.nitrous.io/docs/ide-overview), enter the following commands in the terminal window:

1. `cd ~/code/redux-tutorial`
2. `npm run example 01_simple-action-creator.js`

Now you've got a development server running and can see the output in the Nitrous terminal window. You can open up a new shell or utilize [tmux](https://community.nitrous.io/docs/tmux) to open new shells to run other commands.
