// Tutorial 9 - dispatch-async-action-2.js

// Let's try to run the first async action creator that we wrote in dispatch-async-action-1.js.

import { createStore, combineReducers } from 'redux'

var reducer = combineReducers({
    speaker: function (state = {}, action) {
        console.log('speaker was called with state', state, 'and action', action);

        switch (action.type) {
            case 'SAY':
                return {
                    ...state,
                    message: action.message
                };
            default:
                return state;
        }
    }
});
var store_0 = createStore(reducer);

var asyncSayActionCreator_1 = function (message) {
    return function (dispatch) {
        setTimeout(function () {
            dispatch({
                type: 'SAY',
                message
            })
        }, 2000)
    }
};

console.log("\n", 'Running our async action creator:', "\n");
store_0.dispatch(asyncSayActionCreator_1('Hi'));

// Output:
//     ...
//     /Users/classtar/Codes/redux-tutorial/node_modules/redux/node_modules/invariant/invariant.js:51
//         throw error;
//               ^
//     Error: Invariant Violation: Actions must be plain objects. Use custom middleware for async actions.
//     ...

// It seems that our function didn't even reach our reducers. But Redux has been kind enough to give us a
// tip: "Use custom middleware for async actions.". It looks like we're on the right path but what is this
// "middleware" thing?

// Just to reassure you, our action creator asyncSayActionCreator_1 is well-written and will work as expected
// as soon as we've figured out what is a middleware and how to use it.

// Go to next tutorial: middleware.js
